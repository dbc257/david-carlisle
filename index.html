    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>While there are many things that I could write about myself,</p> 
    <p>I am essentially like this symbolic circle that is called "Ensō" in Japanese.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://medium.com/@mariogomes/analysis-of-the-ensō-symbol-f200f0798692">Ensō (円相)</a> is: </p>
    <ul> 
      <li>a Japanese word meaning "circle"</li>
      <li>a manifestation of the moment</li>
      <li>an expression of absolute enlightenment</li>
      <li>a representation of our true and intimate self</li>
    </ul>
    <p>People can find many other meanings for Ensō.</p>
    <p>Like me, it is a paradox.</p> 
    <p>Ensō is both full and empty.</p>
